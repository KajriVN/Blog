Hi, I'm **Katjri**, an **Information Security** student at **Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology and Engineering (HCMUTE)** and also a member of the **Information Security Club**.

This is my digital garden where I document my journey into the depths of low-level systems, **Reverse Engineering**, and **Malware Analysis**.

This blog serves as a repository for my research, analysis notes, and technical guides. While my ultimate goal is to specialize in the **Blue Team** (Defensive Security), I believe that to defend a fortress, one must understand how to breach it.

Currently, I am diving deep into **Malware Development** to better understand the mindset and techniques of adversaries. By dissecting malicious code and understanding how it is built, I aim to develop more effective detection and mitigation strategies.

## Focus Areas

Here, you will find articles and write-ups covering various aspects of my learning path:

- **Reverse Engineering:** Disassembling binaries to understand their inner workings.
- **Malware Analysis:** Static and dynamic analysis of real-world samples.
- **Malware Development:** Writing custom loaders and implants for educational purposes.
- **Blue Team Tactics:** translating offensive knowledge into defensive signatures.
- **CTF Write-ups:** Solutions and methodologies from security competitions.
- **Tooling:** Scripts and tools developed to assist in analysis.

## Let's Connect

I am always open to discussing security research, collaboration, or just chatting about the latest threats in the wild.
